\label{cha:Final Considerations}
The motivation of this project is to help Lua programmers to understand and optimize dynamically typed code. Here we described an extraction tool for Lua programs that is capable of reporting the program's function types in an friendly way. A type extraction tool is useful for dynamically typed code, as it provides information extracted during runtime, but inspecting a Lua program is a challenging task as we must deal with proper tail calls, first class functions and associative arrays. The information described in this document serves as an stimulus for understanding the relationship bewtween statically typed languages and dinamically typed ones. It also poses as a contribuition for the Lua community as a complementary tool for code profiling and inspection.
    The source code as well as a brief documentation is available at https://github.com/fvcortes/TypeExtractor
